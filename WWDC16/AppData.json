    "description":"/* Ever since I was 13 years old, I have always been a huge Apple Fan.  Every year, I've made it a habit to watch the WWDC keynote.  I've viewed past WWDC sessions, followed #wwdc on twitter closely, and have always kept a keen eye on everything WWDC.  In short, Iâ€™ve been OBSESSED with WWDC!\n\nSince I first put my hands on an Apple device in 2006 (an iMac), I've fallen in love with what Apple has done.  Steve Jobs has for a long time been one of my idols and a person I look up to and respect.  His impact is only second in my life to that of my grandpa (who passed away earlier this year).  Both my grandpa and Steve Jobs made a lasting impact on the people they interacted with and also the community at large.  I aspire to one day have such an impact and feel I can only do so through technology.\n\nAttending WWDC16 would mean a LOT to me.  I feel attending WWDC16 would be an incredibly unique chance to become a better programmer, learn invaluable techniques, ask my questions to outstanding engineers, and most of all, meet other like minded people.  Living in Buffalo, we do not have a huge developer community, and many of the people I have met are either out of state or even out of the country.  WWDC would expose me to so much more and I would be so deeply grateful to Apple if you choose to afford me this opportunity.\n\nThank you so very much for taking the time to go through my WWDC app.  I hope to see you in June! :)\n\n-gregg */",
